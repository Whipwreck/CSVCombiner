# CSVCombiner
Project for combining 2 CSV's based on a shared data set

The goal of this project is to take 2 data sets (in CSV format) and combine them based on a common column of data.

Example:

csv 1    +    csv 2    =    csv 3 
 1 a           1 A          1 a A
 2 b           2 B          2 b B
 3 c           3 C          3 c C
 4 d           4 D          4 d D
